A rotor-bearing testbed (Figure 1) was built to analyze the health condition of the shaft with unbalance defects.The rotating speed of the test-bed is 20 Hz, and screws were added on the disk of the shaft to induce unbalance defects as shown in Figure 2. An accelerometer was mounted on the bearing block and to measure the bearing's vibrations. The vibration data were collected under balanced and unbalanced conditions at a rate of 2560 Hz

    The implementation of SVM utilizing 1X and 2X harmonic amplitudes as features has demonstrated a significant potential for accurately assessing the health condition of rotor-bearing systems. Our analysis not only confirms the relevance of these harmonics in fault diagnosis but also highlights SVM's capability to effectively classify system states with high precision. The comparative analysis with logistic regression underscores the advanced modeling power of SVM for complex classification tasks in industrial applications.
